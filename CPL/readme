# CPL Model - PINN Implementation

This folder contains the implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) applied to the CPL (Chevallier-Polarski-Linder) dark energy parametrization. The goal is to approximate the luminosity distance integral and perform parameter inference.

## Folder Structure

### Training Scripts
- `train_CPL.py` → Trains the PINN to approximate the luminosity distance.

### Benchmarking & Error Analysis
- `CPL_benchmarking_2.py` → Generates error maps and compares PINN predictions with the analytical solution.

### Inference and Model Evaluation
- `inferencia.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook used to perform parameter inference and analyze trained models.

### Pretrained Models
These are trained models used in the thesis:
- `CPL_param30_inferencia`
- `CPL_param_dict`

These can be loaded for predictions without retraining.

## Running the Code

### Training a Model
Run:
```bash
python train_CPL.py

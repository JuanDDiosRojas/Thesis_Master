# QCDM Model - PINN Implementation

This folder contains the implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the Klein-Gordon equation in the context of quintessence dark energy models. The goal is to reconstruct cosmological parameters without assuming initial conditions.

## Folder Structure

### Training and Model Implementation
- `quintaesencia_datos.ipynb` → Trains the PINN for the quintessence model.

### Visualization and Analysis
- `rho_w_quintaesencia.ipynb` → Generates graphs of the model predictions in terms of redshift (z), using Cosmic Chronometer data for comparison.

### Previous Versions (Reference)
- `quintaesencia.ipynb`
- `quintaesencia`

These contain earlier versions of the model and serve as a reference.

### Other Files
- `readme` → Initial README file.

## Running the Code

### Training the Model
Open and run:
```bash
jupyter notebook quintaesencia_datos.ipynb

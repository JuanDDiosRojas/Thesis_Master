# Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Cosmology

This repository contains implementations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) applied to different cosmological models. The goal is to solve differential equations relevant to cosmology without requiring predefined initial conditions.

## Folder Structure

- `CPL/` → PINN implementation for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) dark energy parametrization.
- `LCDM/` → PINN implementation for the ΛCDM model, comparing reparametrization and cost function approaches.
- `QCDM/` → PINN implementation for quintessence models, solving the Klein-Gordon equation.
- `functions.py` → Contains utility functions used across the different models.

Each folder contains its own README with specific details on running the code.

## Requirements
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install torch numpy scipy matplotlib tqdm
